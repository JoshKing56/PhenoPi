## What is this?
This repo contains all of the code that makes the PhenoPi phenotyping rig work. It has several components:
1. Code for the python application on the raspberry pi
2. Recieving end code for the host machine

## Features
1. Easy to use web based interface
2. Automatic syncing with google drive
3. Metadata recording + hashing
4. Multi camera support
5. Auto-updating: every push to master updates the code

## How to use:
1. Boot up the device (plugging it in)
2. Modify information on screen if necessary, click "take picture"
4. **Wait a few seconds** this script takes time, mostly to let the cameras adjust their lights. 
5. Check google drive to confirm file is there
